# Horizonte Corpus

This repo contains scripts for the creation of the Horizonte parallel corpus which was done as part of a programming project at the University of Zurich in 2018.

A detailed report describing each script and how to call them can be found in the PDF `SNF_Horizonte_Corpus_Report`.

An overview of the corpus and an updated version in the UZH PaCoCo format can be found here: https://pub.cl.uzh.ch/wiki/public/pacoco/horizonte?s[]=horizons.
